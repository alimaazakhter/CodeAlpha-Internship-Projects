Q1. Why did you choose Logistic Regression for this project?
A1. Logistic Regression is a simple and effective algorithm for classification problems. Since the Iris dataset is clean, small, and linearly 
    separable — Logistic Regression performs very well and gives high accuracy. It also helps understand how 
    basic classification works before trying complex models.

Q2. Why didn’t you use KNN, Decision Tree, or SVM?
A2. I focused on Logistic Regression for simplicity and interpretability. However, I’m aware of other models like KNN and SVM which could work well too. 
    For this project, since Logistic Regression already gave 100% accuracy, trying other models wasn't necessary — but I can easily extend the notebook to compare them if needed.

Q3️. What kind of preprocessing or data cleaning did you do?
A3. I checked for:
    1. Null values (there were none)
    2. Duplicate rows (removed if found)
    3. Encoded the target variable (species) using LabelEncoder
    4. Split the dataset into training and test sets using train_test_split

    The dataset was already very clean, so minimal preprocessing was needed.

Q4️. What does the Confusion Matrix show in your results?
A4. The confusion matrix showed that all predictions were correct — no misclassifications. Each class (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) was perfectly predicted, 
indicating 100% model accuracy.

Q5️. How many classes are there in the target variable?
A5. There are three classes:

    0: Setosa
    1: Versicolor
    2: Virginica

Q6️. How is the data distributed across these classes?
A6. Each species has 50 samples, so the dataset is balanced, which helps the model learn equally well for all classes.

Q7️. What insights did you get from the Pairplot and Heatmap?
A7. Pairplot showed that Setosa is clearly separated from the other two species, especially based on petal features.
    Heatmap showed that petal length and petal width are highly correlated, while sepal width had weaker correlations.

Q8️. What is the accuracy of your model?
A7. The Logistic Regression model gave 100% accuracy on the test dataset.

Q9️. Which features are most important for classification?
A9. Petal length and petal width are the most important features — they provide the clearest separation between the classes, especially Setosa vs others.

Q1️0. If the dataset had more noise or was imbalanced, what would you change?
A10. I would try more robust models like Random Forest or SVM, apply normalization, handle class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE, 
and use cross-validation for better evaluation.
