**Full Explaination of the Box Plot**

📦 What is a Box Plot? 
-> A box plot is a statistical graph that helps us visualize how data is spread across different values — especially useful for comparing distributions across different categories like years.

🎯 Now for Your Covid Unemployment Box Plot
📍 What it shows:
In our case, it shows:

***How unemployment rates were distributed in 2019 & 2020***

For each year:

1. 📏 Middle line inside the box = Median unemployment rate

2. 🔲 Box itself = where most of the data lies (25% to 75%) — called IQR

3. 🔼 Whiskers = min and max values without outliers

4. ❗ Dots outside the whiskers = Outliers — like April-May 2020 spike due to lockdown

🔹 2019:
1. Unemployment was stable
2. Median was low
3. IQR (spread) was tight — meaning less variation month to month
4. No major outliers — steady economy

🔹 2020:
1. Unemployment rate increased drastically during lockdown (April–May)
2. Boxplot shows:
     > Higher median
     > Bigger IQR (spread increased)
     > Outliers present — especially for states badly hit
3. Clearly shows Covid’s shock effect

**Final Explanation of Box Plot**
> In this boxplot, I compared the distribution of unemployment rates between 2019 and 2020, based on monthly data available in my dataset.

> In 2019, the unemployment rate was generally stable throughout the year. The box is shorter, indicating that most values were close together, and there were no significant          outliers.

> In contrast, in 2020, the boxplot shows a much wider box, meaning the unemployment rates varied a lot. There are also clear outliers, especially during April and May, which         correspond to the first nationwide Covid-19 lockdown. These outliers show sharp spikes in unemployment, particularly in rural and urban regions.

This boxplot visually proves how Covid-19 directly impacted employment in 2020, causing both a higher median unemployment rate and more volatility in monthly data.

**Seasonal Trends**

***Line Plot Explanation***

1. Peaks = Months where unemployment rate goes up (e.g., April–May lockdown)

2. Dips = More employment, maybe due to festivals, harvest season, or job cycles

3. Repeating patterns across years = seasonal trends

This monthly trend line shows that unemployment consistently peaked around April–May, likely due to Covid-19 lockdown in 2020. Months like November–December showed relatively lower unemployment, possibly due to seasonal jobs and end-of-year hiring. Identifying such patterns can help policymakers plan employment schemes during high-risk periods.

***Heat Map Explanation*** 

📊 What is a Heatmap
> A heatmap is like a color-coded table.
It helps us see patterns quickly by using colors to show how high or low the values are.

Heatmap shows:

1. Rows = Year (2019, 2020)
2. Columns = Month (Jan to Dec)
3. Cell value = Average Unemployment Rate for that month & year
4. Color = How high the unemployment rate is
         🔴 Dark red = high unemployment
         🟡 Light color = low unemployment

Explanation:  

> This heatmap shows the average unemployment rate for each month and year using colors.
  I can easily see that in 2020, the months like April and May are much darker — this clearly shows a spike in unemployment during the Covid lockdown.
  Lighter months like October to December have lower rates, meaning more people were employed.

> These additional visualizations help clearly identify which months consistently have high unemployment, and whether the pattern is consistent across years. The heatmap, for         example, shows intensity levels and makes it easier to communicate seasonal impacts to non-technical audiences.

### 🗺️ Average Unemployment Rate Map (2019–2020)

This geo-bubble map represents the **average unemployment rate** across Indian states during the years **2019–2020**.

- **Each bubble** indicates a state.
- **Bubble color** intensity and **size** both represent the **Estimated Unemployment Rate (%)**.
- States like **Tripura, Bihar, and Haryana** show **darker and larger bubbles**, indicating higher unemployment rates.
- States like **Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Gujarat** have **smaller, lighter bubbles**, indicating relatively lower unemployment.

This visualization helps identify **regional disparities** and highlights states that may need **policy intervention or employment programs**.

### 📽️ Unemployment Rate Animation (Monthly Trend: 2019–2020)

This animated geo-bubble map visualizes the **monthly changes** in the **Estimated Unemployment Rate (%)** across Indian states during **2019 and 2020**.

- The **animation frames represent months** from Jan 2019 to Dec 2020.
- **Bubble size and color** indicate the unemployment rate in that particular month for each state.
- Noticeable **spike in unemployment rates around March–June 2020**, which directly correlates with the **nationwide Covid-19 lockdowns**.
- Some states show **high volatility month-to-month**, indicating **instability or dependency on seasonal/informal employment**.

📌 This dynamic visualization provides a **time-based perspective** on how the pandemic and other factors affected employment across India.

### 🔵 Unemployment vs Labour Participation Map

This geo-bubble map presents a **dual-indicator analysis** of Indian states:

- **Bubble Size → Estimated Unemployment Rate (%)**
- **Bubble Color → Labour Participation Rate (%)**

**Interpretation**:

- **Large + Dark bubbles** → States with **high unemployment** and **high labour participation**, suggesting a **workforce that is active but lacks job opportunities**.
- **Small + Light bubbles** → States with **lower unemployment** but also **lower participation**, which may reflect **under-engagement in the workforce** (e.g. lack of access, skill gaps, or discouraged workers).

This visualization helps identify **imbalances** where people are willing to work but jobs aren't available — aiding in **targeted skill development** and **employment generation strategies**.
