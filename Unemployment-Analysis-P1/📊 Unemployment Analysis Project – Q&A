1Ô∏è‚É£ What was the goal of this project?
Answer:
The goal was to analyze the unemployment rate across different Indian states, identify patterns and trends, investigate the impact of COVID-19 on unemployment, 
and visualize the data to extract meaningful insights that could support economic or social policy decisions.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Which dataset did you use?
Answer:
I used two datasets:
    1. Unemployment data (755 entries): includes region, date, unemployment rate, employment, and labour participation rate.
    2. State coordinates data: includes latitude and longitude of each Indian state for mapping.

3Ô∏è‚É£ What kind of data cleaning did you perform?
Answer:
    1. Checked and handled missing values (e.g., Puducherry & Chandigarh lat/lng).
    2. Removed extra spaces from column names.
    3. Verified data types and converted Date column to datetime format.
    4. Removed or handled duplicates if found.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Which visualizations did you use?
Answer:
    1. Line plots to show unemployment trends over time.
    2. Boxplots to identify state-wise unemployment spread and outliers.
    3. Heatmaps to visualize correlation between employment metrics.
    4. Animated scatter map (Plotly) to show monthly unemployment variations across India.
    5. Color-size map showing labour participation (color) vs unemployment rate (bubble size).

5Ô∏è‚É£ What insights did you get from your analysis?
Answer:

>The unemployment rate peaked in mid-2020, showing clear impact of COVID-19.
>Some states had consistently high unemployment (e.g., Bihar), while others had low rates (e.g., Gujarat).
>Petal features showed clearer trends compared to sepal.
>Labour participation dropped during pandemic months in several states.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Why did you merge the coordinate dataset?
Answer:
To enable geo-visualization. By adding latitude and longitude to each state, I could plot maps showing spatial trends and compare states visually using Plotly 
and scatter maps.

7Ô∏è‚É£ What does your animated map show?
Answer:
It shows month-wise change in unemployment rates across Indian states. It helps understand which states were affected the most and how the situation 
changed over time ‚Äî especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

8Ô∏è‚É£ What challenges did you face during the project?
Answer:
   1. Missing values for some states in the coordinates file.
   2. Normalizing column names and date parsing.
   3. Mapping long-form data with time-based animations.
   4. Understanding the difference between ‚ÄúUrban‚Äù and ‚ÄúRural‚Äù data under the Area column.

9Ô∏è‚É£ Which tools and libraries did you use?
Answer:

Pandas, NumPy: Data cleaning and manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly Express: Visualization

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code: Development environment

üîü How could this project be useful for policy makers?
Answer:
The project highlights state-wise and time-based trends in unemployment, helping identify:

  1. Areas needing job support or government intervention
  2. Pandemic impact zones
  3. Seasonal fluctuations in employment
     This can guide targeted economic relief programs.
